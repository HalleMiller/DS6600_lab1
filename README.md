# DS6600_lab1

For this git repository, I chose to use the MIT License. The MIT license allows anyone to use the code in this git repository "without restriction." They can use it in any way, and they have permission to modify or distribute the code. The license itself does not explicitly address commerical or non-commercial use, however on git hub, under the permissions section describing this licnece, both ommerical and private use are checked. The MIT license specifically states "permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software." I interpreted this as, if someone were to use this code, the same permissions that I have set must also apply to anything that they create.
